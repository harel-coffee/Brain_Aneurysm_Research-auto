NEUROASSIST: AN INTELLIGENT SECURE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR PREDICTION OF BRAIN ANEURYSM RUPTURE, FUNDED BY BRAIN ANEURYSM FOUNDATION AND OAKLAND UNIVERSITY
There are four main goals of this work:
Goal I) Big data in healthcare include Internet of thing (IoT) or Wearable Body Sensor (WBS) data streams from senior livings/ hospital, with structured data from EMR, unstructured clinical notes and video data of surgeries. To increase the value of data and research, the two important aspects of Big Data: Veracity and Variety of data will play crucial role in futuristic observational studies of healthcare. To ensure veracity, we use semantic enabled mining of data and various other machine learning methods. Our framework will ensure built-in privacy preserved, veracity and semantic enabled querying mechanisms from variety of Big data to extract required data for clinical studies. We are using UMLS and Bio-portal ontologies (e.g SNOMED CT), various video and speech processing techniques, data anonymization techniques, and semantic enrichment techniques to achieve this goal.
Goal II) Prediction of Intracranial aneurysm rupture: Neurosurgeons are in dire need to have decision support system to infer whether aneurysm be operated immediately or not. Our work aims to save lives from sudden death by predicting the rupture of aneurysm using extracting and integrating data features from structured and unstructured EMRs, WBS, MRI, CT Scan and MRA. This project is funded by Brain Aneurysm Foundation and Oakland University.The collaborators include Neuroscience Insitute Henry Ford Health System Michigan, and University of Michigan.
Goal III) To automatically generate machine understandable aneurysm knowledge required for Neuroassist framework. we will use natural language processing (NLP), morphological analysis of brain images, knowledge-based information extraction along with statistical analysis operations on biomedical literature, clinical guidelines, and clinical narratives.
To develop Neuroassist chatbot that will attend meeting of neurosurgons giving its own opinion about prediction of any aneurysm rupture.
